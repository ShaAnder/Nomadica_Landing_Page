### NOMADICA

This is a landing page for a fictional game called nomadica, it's created using a combination of traditional CSS and bootstrap4 as part of the full stack web development course.

While not a portfolio project per se, as this project was made as an alternative to just following along with an example project. I decided to showcase it was it's own thing because it comprises of a lot of work and skills i actively developed just to finish it.

One notable part I am happy wiht is the dynamically changing nav bar, that not only changes responsively but will shift around the page as the user scrolls through allowing for a clean and concise layout all the way.
