### NOMADICA

This is a landing page for a fictional sci fi horror game called "nomadica" created in place of the standard follow along project for the bootstrap module of my full stack web development diploma.

The objective of this module was to follow along with the project and build a page with bootstrap. However boostrap while a powerful tool is very restrictive in that it's hard to edit / override css in a fully bootstrap page and as a result of largely being a framework bootstrap websites often look samey.

SO with this project I set out to learn how to use bootstrap in a hybrid manner alongside CSS. Utilizing essential booststrap classes and the grid system while keeping full control for more traditional aspects of the website such as the nav bar. Which is not only responsive but dynamic on mobile. This could not have been achieved with mainly bootstrap / bootstrap only.

As a result of utilizing bothe languages this website really does stand out a lot more than if it had been made with just one or the other and it highlights the value of both. Bootstrap really speeds up the development process but it's never a good idea to solely rely on it.
